unified cache: 
    data and instructions in the same cache

direct map:
    memory addresses are mapped to cache lines using: (address mod cache_size)
    cache index contains implicit lower bits of memory address
    cache offset contains offset for the word in cache
    cache tag contains the remaining identifier bits to map back to memory address

block size: 
    4 words (32-bits each) per block/line

RAM:
    
2^32 address space for RAM (4 GB)
L1 cache: 8 kb

            2^5 = 32 address space


write-through or write-back:
    
    First, implement write-through.
