TODO:

GUI

[X]   implement breakpoints
[X]   implement step until breakpoint
[X]   implement step until completion
[ ]   correctly export/restore program
[ ]   catch exceptions rather than crashing
[ ]   split display format into two options for data display and address/tag/idx display
[X]   Use pipeline-enabled button to set attribute in simulator
[X]   Get rid of LRU/Write Policy buttons.
[X]   Force users to use valid cache sizes (2^X)

Pipeline

[X]   pipeline/no-pipeline mode
[ ]   Handle multiple stage ALU operations
[ ]   implement other operations
[ ]   implement syscall to exit
[ ]   test correctness

Benchmarks

[ ]   develop assembly benchmarks
   
Assembler

[X]    Support negative immediate and offsets: this should convert to appropriate
        size two's complement (16 bits for immediates)
[X]    Assemble floating point instructions
[X]    Support sections (.data / .text)
[X]    Add in all MIPS instructions
[X]    Allow labels to refer to variables in .data
[X]    Change register names to match MIPS naming ($v0, $t0, etc.)
[X]    support syscall command
[-]    Documentation
  Optional
[ ]    Validate keywords (eg labels can be instruction names, registers 0-31)
[ ]    Code validation, helpful error messsages
