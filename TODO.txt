[ ]   split display format into two options for data display and address/tag/idx display

Pipeline

[ ]   pipeline/no-pipeline mode
[ ]   implement other operations
      implement syscall to exit
[ ]   test correctness

Benchmarks

[ ]   develop assembly benchmarks
   
Assembler

[X]    Support negative immediate and offsets: this should convert to appropriate
        size two's complement (16 bits for immediates)
[ ]    Assemble floating point instructions
[ ]    Documentation

[ ]    Support sections (.data / .text)
[ ]    Add in all MIPS instructions
[ ]    Allow labels to refer to variables in .data
[ ]    Code validation, helpful error messsages
[ ]    Validate keywords (eg labels can be instruction names, registers 0-31)
[ ]    Change register names to match MIPS naming ($v0, $t0, etc.)
[ ]    support syscall command
